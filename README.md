# Video Game Sales Analysis – GameCo Project
## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of my Introduction to Data Analytics coursework.
The goal was to perform a descriptive analysis of a video game sales dataset to help a fictional company, GameCo, make data-informed decisions about developing and marketing new video games.

The dataset includes historical sales of games (that sold over 10,000 copies) across various platforms, genres, and publishers from 1980 to 2016, sourced from VGChartz.

## Objective

To understand the video game market and provide actionable insights to GameCo executives by exploring:

Which game genres are the most popular.

Who the main competitors are in different markets.

How sales trends have changed over time.

How sales vary across geographic regions.

## Tools & Skills Used

Excel: data cleaning, transformation, pivot tables, and visualization

Descriptive statistics: measures of central tendency and dispersion

Data storytelling: developing insights and presenting findings

## Data Cleaning

The raw dataset contained inconsistent entries, missing values, and formatting issues.
Cleaning steps included:

Removing or correcting missing and inconsistent values.

Standardizing region names and formats.

Ensuring numerical data consistency across all sales columns.

## Data Analysis

Once cleaned, the dataset was explored using pivot tables and Excel formulas to summarize sales patterns:

Grouped games by genre, platform, and region.

Calculated total and average sales for each category.

Identified top-performing genres and publishers.

Analyzed regional performance to detect dominant markets.

## Visualizations

Three main types of visualizations were created to support insights:

Bar Charts – to compare total sales by genre and publisher.

Line Charts – to show sales trends over time.

Box Plots – to visualize the distribution of global sales.


## Deliverables

Cleaned and formatted Excel dataset.

Pivot tables summarizing sales performance.

A PowerPoint presentation visualizing and narrating key insights.

## Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of:

The complete data analysis workflow, from cleaning to visualization.

The importance of data storytelling for business decision-making.

Using Excel as an analytical tool for pattern recognition and hypothesis testing.
